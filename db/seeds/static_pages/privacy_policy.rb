  '<h2>Who we are</h2><p>The Foundation Year Network is a group of people '\
  'working in, or closely related to the provision of foundation year '\
  'education. We are a UK based group, although we welcome members from all '\
  'over the world. Our purpose, as defined by our constitutional objects, is '\
  'to represent, promote and support:</p><ul><li> Good practice in foundation '\
  'year provision;</li><li> The academic and scholarly activities of '\
  'foundation year practitioners;</li><li>Continuing professional development '\
  'opportunities for foundation year practitioners.</li><li> Diversity of '\
  'provision for entry into higher education</li><li> To organise an annual '\
  'Foundation Year Network Conference</li></ul><p>We have been holding annual '\
  'conferences since 2007 to discuss the issues that have faced foundation '\
  'year provision, best practice, scholarship, transitions, and to share the '\
  'trials and tribulations of working in the foundation year sector in the '\
  'UK. In 2011 it was recognised that a nationally representative body for '\
  'Foundation Year practitioners was becoming needed and so the Network began '\
  'a transition into a constituted association. The Foundation Year Network '\
  'agreed the constitution at its 2014 Annual Conference and is now finding '\
  'its feet on the national stage, providing a resource and a collective '\
  'voice for practitioners in the sector.</p><h2>What personal data we '\
