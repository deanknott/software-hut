  '<p>The Foundation Year Network is a group of people working in, or closely '\
  'related to the provision of foundation year education. We are a UK based '\
  'group, although we welcome members from all over the world. Our purpose, '\
  'as defined by our constitutional objects, is to represent, promote and '\
  'support:</p><ul><li> Good practice in foundation year provision;</li>'\
  '<li>The academic and scholarly activities of foundation year practitioners;'\
  '</li><li>Continuing professional development opportunities for foundation '\
  'year practitioners.</li><li>Diversity of provision for entry into higher '\
  'education</li><li>To organise an annual Foundation Year Network Conference '\
  '</li></ul><p>We have been holding annual conferences since 2007 to discuss '\
  'the issues that have faced foundation year provision, best practice, '\
  'scholarship, transitions, and to share the trials and tribulations of '\
  'working in the foundation year sector in the UK. In 2011 it was recognised '\
  'that a nationally representative body for Foundation Year practitioners was'\
  ' becoming needed and so the Network began a transition into a constituted '\
  'association. The Foundation Year Network agreed the constitution at its '\
  '2014 Annual Conference and is now finding its feet on the national stage, '\
  'providing a resource and a collective voice for practitioners in the sector'\
  '.</p><p>If you would like to get involved with the Network, would like to '\
  'ask members for help or advice, or would like to know more about '\
  'Foundation Year provision in the UK, please get in touch. Membership of '\
  'the Network is free. Members are welcome from outside of the UK, as are '\
  'Non-academic members, if they have a clear and relevant interest in '\
  'foundation year provision. Applications for membership not using a valid '\
  'academic email address may experience delay in their membership '\
  'application, or may be declined membership unless they complete the full '\
  'application form and include details of their relevant interest in '\
  'foundation year provision.</p><p>If you apply for membership you are '\
  'agreeing to the Associationâ€™s Objects, and to abide by the Constitution '\
  'of the Foundation Year Network.</p>')
