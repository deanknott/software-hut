# Foundation Year Network Project
This project was contracted by the Foundation Year Network to produce a centralised database of all degrees with foundation years. Before creation of this project, there was no centralised database containing exclusively degrees with foundation year options. The aim of this project was to provide such functionality.

We were also tasked with re-creating their current website on a more up-to-date architecture in order to provide a more easily accessibly user experience.


### Significant Features/Technology
The system has the following:

* A centralised database of all degrees with foundation years
* An ability for Network Members to register for an account and see member only areas
* The ability for members to post blogs and keep users up-to-date
* The ability to subscribe to email notifications about new degrees with foundation year that meet your chosen criteria.


### Deployment
*QA -> Demo -> Production* using the `epi-deploy` gem.
